# Business Continuity and Risk Management Project

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive **risk assessment** and **business impact analysis (BIA)** for a university's **online learning platform**, leveraging the **OCTAVE Allegro framework**. The primary goal is to:
- Identify critical information assets
- Evaluate potential threats and risks
- Prioritize those risks
- Recommend effective mitigation strategies

The outcome ensures enhanced business continuity and strengthens the platform's cybersecurity posture.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The project is divided into three key milestones:

### ðŸ”¹ Milestone 1: OCTAVE Allegro Risk Assessment 
- Defined key information assets
- Identified potential threats and vulnerabilities
- Evaluated and ranked risks based on **operational**, **reputational**, and **compliance** impact
- Suggested mitigation techniques for high-priority risks

### ðŸ”¹ Milestone 2: Business Impact Analysis (BIA) 
- Identified **critical business assets**
- Prioritized assets using a **weighted analysis table**
- Defined:
  - **Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs)**
  - **Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs)**

### ðŸ”¹ Milestone 3: Attack Profile & Damage Assessment 
- Analyzed potential **attack vectors** (e.g., phishing, DoS, unauthorized API access)
- Assessed **attacker motivations** and **technical capabilities**
- Modeled **damage scenarios**:
  - Best-case
  - Most likely
  - Worst-case
- Recommended **countermeasures** to mitigate identified risks

## ðŸ“Œ Key Deliverables

- **Risk Assessment Worksheets**:  
  Comprehensive analysis of risks across domains like reputation, finance, and productivity, with scoring.

- **Critical Asset Prioritization**:  
  Ranking of essential components such as:
  - Content Management System (CMS) / Portal  
  - Authentication Server  
  - Student Records System  

- **Attack Profiles**:  
  In-depth study of likely attack methods, including:
  - Phishing  
  - LMS vulnerabilities  
  - Denial of Service (DoS) attacks  
  Mitigation strategies for each are outlined.

## ðŸ§° Tools and Frameworks Used

- **OCTAVE Allegro**  
  Used for structured, asset-based risk assessment.

- **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**  
  Applied for evaluating asset criticality and defining recovery parameters.

- **Attack Profile Framework**  
  Utilized for identifying threat actors, attack vectors, and damage potential.
